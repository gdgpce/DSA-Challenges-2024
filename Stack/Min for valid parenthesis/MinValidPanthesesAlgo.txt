Algorithm:

1.Initialize Counters:
Create two integer variables: open and close, both initialized to 0.
open: This will count unmatched opening parentheses '('.
close: This will count unmatched closing parentheses ')'.

2.Iterate Through Each Character:
Loop through each character c in the input string s:
a.If c is an opening parenthesis '(':Increment the open counter by 1 (open++).
b.If c is a closing parenthesis ')':
  Check if there are unmatched opening parentheses:
    If open > 0:
    Decrement the open counter by 1 (open--) since this closing parenthesis can match an opening one.
  Otherwise:
    Increment the close counter by 1 (close++) because this closing parenthesis is unmatched.

4.Calculate the Result:
After iterating through all characters, the total number of parentheses that need to be added to make the string valid is:
result=open+close

5.Return or Print the Result:
Return or print the calculated result.
